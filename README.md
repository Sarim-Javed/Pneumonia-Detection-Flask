#Pneumonia-Detection-Flask
This project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The trained model is deployed using a Flask web application, making it accessible and easy to use for healthcare professionals and researchers.

##Overview
Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can be life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Traditional methods of diagnosis can be time-consuming and require expert analysis. This project aims to provide a fast, accurate, and automated tool for pneumonia detection using deep learning techniques.

##Features
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a labeled dataset of chest X-ray images to classify images as either 'Pneumonia' or 'Normal'.
Web Interface: A user-friendly Flask web application that allows users to upload chest X-ray images and get instant predictions.
Visualization: Displays the uploaded X-ray image and prediction results on the web interface.
Scalability: Designed to be easily deployable on cloud platforms for broader accessibility.

##Installation
1-Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Pneumonia-Detection-Flask.git
2-Navigate to the project directory:
cd Pneumonia-Detection-Flask
3-Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

##Usage
1-Start the Flask app:
python run.py
2-Open your web browser and go to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
3-Upload a chest X-ray image and receive an instant prediction.
